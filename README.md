# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Wenjuan Zhang**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are to be implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Create a tip slider that adjusts the tip percentage.
- [x] Make a tip splitting feature
- [ ] A settings page to change the currency (based on global location) or the default tip

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

1) Need to use virtual box to host a mac os (catalina) on a Windows 10 machine: lots of configuration issues, like no simulator responding.
2) Time consuming when connectting to the virtual machine and work in the virtual machine.
